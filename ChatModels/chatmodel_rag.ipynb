One day, as Jack was tending to his crops, he decided to take a look at his stomach. \\n\\nThe farmer took a deep breath and pulled the medicine chest out of his cow. \"Here,\" he said, \"take this pickle and sip slowly.\"\\n\\nJack gulped down the pickle, taste sweet and sour. \"Now, take a look,\" said Jack, \"and lift up my shirt. I want a good smell of my pubic hair,\"\\n\\nThe farmer opened his shirt to see muddy cysts. \"Now see â€“ a real cause of stomach pains,\" said Jack, smiling.\\n\\nJack took another sip of the pickle and sat back in his chair. \"Well,\" he laughed, \"I never would have thought a little bit of mustard could cause my pain and discomfort.\" \\n\\nThe farmer chuckled and continued with his work, but the next day, he was down to his last few pickles. Then, something unexpected happened. Jack remembered his mother\\'s wisdom: take care of your health, or she\\'ll take care of you. The farmer started going to the doctor for the rest of his life.\\n\\n\"Now, finally,\" said the doctor, after examining the farmer with the x-ray machine, \"you seem to have no problems, but I\\'d like to warn you of a potential complication in the future. You have stomach ulcers.\"\\n\\n\"Ulcer?\" How could doctors have mentioned this as a complication? But the farmer didn\\'t want to rumys his life over some small injury. He was convinced that doctors only heard words that exaggerated the results of his treatment.\\n\\nBut before the farmer could say a word, there was a loud blow to his kitchen.\\n\\n\"Did you hear that?\" a man shouted. \"The doctor was looking at your pickles.\"\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': ChatCompletionOutputUsage(completion_tokens=444, prompt_tokens=39, total_tokens=483), 'model': '', 'finish_reason': 'stop'}, id='run-8641a75e-13f0-4aeb-9b9c-eb2e4405596f-0')"
